Description:  high-level interface to any Python environment, including 
    ad-hoc environments such as Anaconda Python and virtual environments. 
	Communication between R and Python is achieved using websockets, meaning that 
	no low-level C interface or makevars configuration is required. Data structures
	are translated between R and Python using JSON, and Python class templates for
	extending JSON support to arbitrary Python objects are provided.
